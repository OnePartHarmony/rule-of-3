                <p>The object of the game is to look through the twelve cards on the board and find a set of three cards that satisfies the rule of three.  Each of the cards contains a symbol which has four properties:<br>Shape: Each symbol is a circle, square, or gumdrop,<br>Color: Each symbol is pink, blue, or green,<br>Number: Each card has one, two, or three identical symbols,<br>and Shading: Each symbol is solid, outlined, or striped.<br><br>(If you haven't played before, first try an easy game with only the solid symbols)<br><br>Three cards count as a "set" if for each of the properties the cards are either <strong>all the same</strong> or <strong>all different.</strong>  For example, if two cards have blue symbols and one does not, the rule is broken and those three cards are not a set.  But if one card has a blue striped square, one has two blue solid circles, and one has three outlined gumdrops, it's a set because number, shape and fill are all different, while color is all the same.<br><br>Win the game by emptying the deck and finding all of the sets on the board.  When a each set has been found, the board will be refilled to twelve.  If you suspect there are no sets on the board, click the deck for three more cards.  (In a regular game of 81 cards, there is only about a 1 in 33 chance of no set in 12 cards)</p>
